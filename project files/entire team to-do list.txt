- Nathroxer:
  - Re-animate wingflex and flight controls once new flightmodel is released
  - animate doors
  - exterior lights ( https://developer.x-plane.com/article/airplane-parameterized-light-guide/ AND https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ingB_EYyC2U )
  - cockpit floodlights
  - cabin
  - reduce visibility of slanted things above doors
  - texture landing gear, make hot brake glow
  - model/texture external light fixtures
  - model button switch covers
  - button lights and animations

- Matt726:
  - Display textures (and some displays?)
  - update datarefs (buttons, cockpit door are done)

- Cactus2456
  - efb and eicas (+ Saharsh)

- Zeta
  - new landing gear and animations

- Crazytimtimtim
  - manipulators (using Noah's refs)
  - replace default toggle command to command up and down default cmds (3 total cmds replaced, indiv up and down cmds will just set the default gear handle pos dr)
  - custom fms
  - check if landing light/taxi/rwy turnoff dimming similar to 744
  - clock code
  - fix flight director switch code
  - custom RAT dataref (use anim tool with target being the default dr)
  - rename cmds/drs for toggle switch to "toggle_switch"
  - rest of displays (fcom is a good ref!)
  - code adiru, Check vids online. Include align time on nd. Formula is in xt.flightInstruments.lua
  - idea for bank limit knob - 6 pos. anim pos dr, set default dr using that UNLESS in auto. auto varies btw 15-25 deg depending on true airspeed
  - ALL THE SYSTEMS AHHHH (match fcom and CBTs!)

- Nutshell
  - review new flightmodel before release

Random note: We should include the CSS (cabin crew controls) system in the EFB. It would be cool.
