## FAQ

**Q: When is the release date?**

A: As we are very early in development, and have no release date at this time.

**Q: Where can I download liveries?**

A: You can download liveries that aren't included with the 777 from from our repository [here](https://github.com/Stratosphere-Studios/Stratosphere-Liveries). This repository also has the official Stratosphere livery for other aircraft. If you are a livery painter and want us to add your livery to the repository, please let us know on the X-Plane forums, Discord, or in a Github issue on the livery repository and we'll add it.

**Q: Where can I follow progress and announcements for this aircraft?**

A: Keep up with the project on our [Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/s25sxgwMRt) You can also see a detailed changelog [here](https://github.com/Stratosphere-Studios/777/commits/main).

**Q: What is the black console window that appears when I start the aircraft?**

A: Don't close it. It helps the developers find bugs and fix them. If you close this window, X-Plane will crash. Along with the log.txt, this is one of the primary tools for investigating issues. **This can be disabled by deleting the xtlua_debugging.txt file from the aircraft's "plugins/xtlua/64/" folder.**

**Q: How do I start the aircraft?**

A: As of now, you can't start the plane from cold and dark because systems have not been implemented yet. For now, enable "Start with engines running" in the aircraft menu. When systems are implemented, you should follow the checklists and manuals found [here.](https://github.com/Stratosphere-Studios/777/tree/main/Documentation)

**Q: How can I contribute to this aircraft?**

A: Please use the [Github issue page](https://github.com/Stratosphere-Studios/777/issues) to report any problems you find. This will greatly help us fix issues.

If you want to help out and you have some dev skills, feel free to fork, modify, and make a pull request!

**Q: Why is my aircraft broken, I get error message, and half the models are gone?**

A: You have selected the wrong aircraft. The 777 download inlcudes two aircraft which show up in the X-Plane menu. One of them is an experimental one we are using to test our new flightmodel work. This one does not have an icon in the X-Plane menu, and it is fairly broken. Make sure you select the aircraft that has the icon!

**Q: Even after following the above instructions my aircraft is still broken?**

A: Please remember this aircraft is still in the works. By downloading from github, you our downloading our experimental dev version, so there will be plenty of bugs and things that don't work. Please be patient as we continue working on the aircraft, and once again, we don't have a set release date yet, so please don't ask!

**Q: Will this aircraft support X-Pane 12?**

A: Of course!

**Q: Why are the physics broken/the plane won't take off/I can barely controle the aircraft?**

A: We know the physics are very broken currenty. We're working on it.
